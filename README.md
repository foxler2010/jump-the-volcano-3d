**Go read the info at https://github.com/foxler2010/jump-the-volcano before doing anything here. You will not regret it.**

With that out of the way:

Hey. Seems you've found my new side-project. It's Jump The Volcano but the interface is 3D.

I used jMonkeyEngine to do all the 3D things, and other than that the codebase is no different than the original game. All updates to the features of Jump The Volcano will be pulled here every time I do a release. Anything that changes the outputs in any way will be implemented in 3D here. Releases here will undoubtedly lag behind the original game because that is the main focus. Either way, I hope you einjoy this version of the game.

Like I said above, go see https://github.com/foxler2010/jump-the-volcano for info on the original game.
